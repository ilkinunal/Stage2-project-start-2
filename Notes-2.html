      <b> Internet </b> is the global system of interconnected computer networks.
      <br>The<b> web</b> is the system we use to access the Internet. 
      <br> <b> HTML </b> stands for <em><b>Hyper Text Markup Language </b></em>  which is the main document type of the web, invented in 1990s.
      <br> <b> Web browser </b> is a program (Internet Explorer , FireFox, Google Chrome, etc) that is located on the computer that is used to display files on the web.
      <br> <b> Server </b> is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other computers over a local network or the Internet.
      <br> <b> HTTP </b> stands for <em><b>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol </b></em>  which is the set of rules for transferring files (text, images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web.

    <div id="link1.2" class="subtitle"> How the Web Works? </div>
      When a user opens a web browser and writes www.udacity.com, the computer sends an HTTP request to a server. The server finds the HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer , the web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. Click this <a href=" https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496"> video</a> to watch the detailed explanation.

    <div>
    <div id="link1.3" class="subtitle"> HTML </div>
      HTML has &#34;Text content&#34; (what you see), &#34;markup&#34; (what it looks), &#34;references to other documents&#34; (images, videos, etc), &#34;links to other pages&#34;.
      <br>HTML consists of a series of codes typed into a text-file by the programmer; 

      <ul>
        <li>  
        <b>TAGs</b> - use <b> &#60; angle-brackets &#62;</b>,most tags have opening and closing tag, but some called &#34;void&#34; tag which does not require a closing tag. 
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Element</b> - includes <b>opening tag</b> &#38; <b>content</b> &#38; <b>closing tag</b>. Elements can be <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>; Block elements create an &#34;invisible box&#34; around the content inside of them, such as &#34;p&#34;, &#34;div&#34;, &#34;form&#34;. &#34;a&#34;, &#34;span&#34;, &#34;br&#34;, &#34;img&#34; and &#34;strong&#34; are all inline elements.
    	  </li>
        <li>
        <b>Attribute</b> - provide additional information about an element , are specified in the opening tag.
        </li>
      </ul>

      The Structure of HTML document :
          <pre>         &#60;html&#62;
              &#60;head&#62; 
                 &#60;title&#62; TITLE &#60;&#47;title&#62;
              &#60;&#47;head&#62;
              &#60;body&#62;  
                 &#60;name&#62; CONTENT &#60;&#47;name&#62;
              &#60;&#47;body&#62; 
          &#60;&#47;html&#62; 
          </pre>

  <h2>***HTML &#38; CSS &#38; DOM </h2>  
 
    <div>
    <div id="link2.1" class="subtitle"> WebPage ingredients </div>
      The browser turns HTML &#34;tags&#34; into &#34;elements&#34; that form a &#34;tree&#34;. It knows how to do that because of the <b>DOM</b> &#34;<b>Document Object Model</b>&#34;, which is a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML. Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page.
      <br>  The document written in HTML defines the <u><b>structure</b></u> and <u><b>content</b></u> of the page.To define the <u><b>style</b></u>, you have to use another language; <b>CSS</b> &#34;<b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>&#34;. CSS is used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
      <br> DOM -a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.

    <div id="link2.2" class="subtitle"> Text Editors for coding </div>
      <ul>
        <li>  <b>ScratchPad</b> : beginner friendly, least powerful, sharing is not possible, HTML &#38; CSS </li>
        <li>  <b>Codepen</b> : powerful, easy for sharing but account needed, HTML &#38; CSS &#38; JavaScript </li>  
        <li>  <b>Sublime</b> : most powerful,but not quite friendly, difficult to share, all languages</li>

    <div id="link2.3" class="subtitle"> Avoiding Repetition </div>
      Coding principle is <em> don&#39;t repeat yourself (<b>DRY</b>)</em>. Avoiding Repetition makes it easier to create &#38; maintain &#38; expand, less likely for errors and mistakes. Also, it makes it faster loading of web pages, enables the clients to save money on bandwidth and development costs.

  <h2>***Python </h2>
    <div>
      <div id="link3.1" class="subtitle"> Introduction to Programming </div> 
      A <b> computer </b> is a machine that can execute a program. With the right program, a computer can do any mechanical computation you can imagine.
      <br>A <b>program</b> describes a very precise sequence of steps. Since the computer is just a machine, the program must give the steps in a way that can be executed mechanically. That is, the program can be followed without any thought.
      <br>A <b>programming language</b> is a language designed for producing computer programs. A good programming language makes it easy for humans to read and write programs that can be executed by a computer. Programmin languages are needed because natural languages are ambiguous and verbose.
      <br> <b>Python</b> is a programming language. The programs that we write in the Python language will be the input to the <b>Python interpreter</b>, which is a program that runs on the computer. The Python interpreter reads our programs and executes them by following the rules of the Python language.
      <br> <b>Grammatical structure</b> is very strict, has to match the rules exactly, otherwise interpreter wouldn’t understand it, and gives error.
      <br> <b>Python expressions</b>:
          <pre>
          Expression    &#8594; Expression Operator Expression
          Expression    &#8594; Number
          Operator      + - * /
          Number        0, 1, ...         
          </pre> 
      <p>Python problem solving starts with "not panicking". Understanding inputs, outputs &#38; relationships, and creating examples are the basics of it. Starting to write as “pseudocode”, not exactly detailed correct code, helps to start solving. </p>
      <br>The trick to dealing with programming mistakes (called "bugs") is not to avoid making them entirely. That's impossible. The trick is to develop a system for finding and fixing them. These strategies help for debugging:
      <ol>
        <li> Examine error messages when programs crash (last line)</li>  
        <li> Work from example code</li>  
        <li> Make sure examples work</li>
        <li> Check (print) intermediate results</li>
        <li> Keep and compare old versions</li>
      </ol>       
    </div>
    <div>
      <div id="link3.2" class="subtitle"> Variables &#38; Strings &#38; Lists </div> 
      <b>Variables</b> give programmers a way to give names to values. Variables can be useful to programmers in many ways:
      <ul>
        <li> They improve code readability by using names that make sense to humans</li>  
        <li> They give us a way to store the value of important data</li>  
        <li> They give us a way to change the value</li>
      </ul> 
      The way to introduce a variable is using an assignment statement. We have a name,followed by an equal symbol, followed by an expression:
      <br> Name = Expression 
      <br>A <b>string</b> is just a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. ‘ or “ can be used, but they have to be same at the beginning and end. Examples :
          <pre>
          print 4                 >>> output : 4
          print "4"               >>> output : 4
          print 4 + 4             >>> output : 8
          print "4" + "4"         >>> output : 44   note: 4 is a number, “4” is a string        
          print "hello’           >>> gives error because of the quotes types        
          </pre> 
      One of the things we can do with strings that we can't do with numbers, is we can extract subsequences from the strings.If we have a string, we can use the square brackets to extract parts of that string.Indexing a string starts from 0-1-2-3 etc., we can also use negative indexing. Examples: 
          <pre>
          ilkin[2]                >>> output : k
          ilkin[-2]               >>> output : i
          ilkin[2:3]              >>> output : k
          ilkin[2:4]              >>> output : ki
          ilkin[2:]               >>> output : kin
          </pre> 
      In addition to using single quotes (') or double quotes (") to create a string, you can also use TRIPLE quotes to create a multi-line string.
      <br>A <b>List</b> is a more powerful and general type of structured data.  Compared to a string where all of the elements must be characters, in a list the elements can be anything you want such as characters, strings, numbers or even other lists.
          <pre>
          String                  List
          s = 'yabba!'            p = ['y','a','b','b','a','!']                  
          s[2:4] -> 'bb'          p[2:4] -> ['b','b']
          </pre> 
    </div>
    <div>
      <div id="link3.3" class="subtitle"> Input&#8594;Function&#8594;Output </div> 
      <b>Functions</b> (procedure) take inputs, and produce outputs. Function blocks begin with the keyword <b>def</b> followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ). Any input parameters (arguments or operands) should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses. Every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
      <br>Functions help programmers avoid repetition by re-using the same definition.
      <br>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.
      <br>Examples:
          <pre>
          def square(n):
            return n * n
          print square (5)       >>> output : 25
          def abbaize(a,b):
            return a + b + b + a
          print abbaize('a','b') >>> output : abba
          def abbaize(a,b):
            c = a + b + b + a
          print abbaize('a','b') >>> output : None
          </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div id="link3.4" class="subtitle"> Control Flow &#38; Loops &#38; Operators</div> 
      Python provides lots of different operators for comparisons, such as greater than (&#62;), less than (&#60;), equal to (==) and not equal to (!=). The output of a comparison is not a number, it is a <b>Boolean</b> value (<b>True</b> or <b>False</b>). 
      <br>‘==’ for equality comparison, ‘=’ for assignment
          <pre>
          i = 21  assingns  21 value to i 
          i==21   returns True or False
          </pre>
      <b>If</b> statement helps to make decision; "if" followed by a comparison (test expression), followed by a colon. And then, inside the "if", there is the block, the block is the code that will run when the test expression is True.
      <br>If the test expression doesn't evaluate to True, the block doesn't execute. Example :
          <pre>
          def bigger(a,b):
            if a>b:
              r=a
            else:
              r=b
            return r
          print bigger(2,9)      >>> output:9
          </pre>
      <b>OR</b> operator displays True if either of the expression True. Only False OR False give False.
      <br><b>While</b> loop is similar to If statement, "While" is followed by a test expression, followed by a colon, and then a "block" has a sequence of instructions. If executes only 1 time, While executes until test expression is False. Example :
          <pre>
          def print_numbers (n):
            i = 1
            while i &#60; n:
              print i
              i = i + 1
            return i
          </pre>
      The <b>append</b> method adds a new element to the end of a list. The append method mutates the list that it is invoked on, it does not create a new list. The syntax for the append method is:
          <pre>
          &#60;list&#62;.append(&#60;element&#62;)
          </pre>
      The <b> + (concatenation) </b> operator can be used with lists and is very similar to how it is used to concatenate strings. It produces a new list, it does not mutate either of the input lists.
          <pre>
          &#60;list&#62; + &#60;list&#62; → &#60;list&#62;
          </pre>
      The <b>len (length) </b> operator can be used to find out the length of an object. The len operator works for many things other than lists, it works for any object that is a collection of things including strings. The output from len is the number of elements in its input.
          <pre>
          len(&#60;list&#62;) → &#60;number&#62;
          </pre>
      Example:
          <pre>
          p = &#91;1,2&#93;
          q = &#91;3,4&#93;
          p.append&#40;q&#41;
          p = p + &#91;4,5&#93;
          len(p)                 >>> output: 5
          </pre>
      In Python, there is a more convenient way to loop through the elements of a list: <b>for loop</b>. The loop goes through each element of the list in turn, assigning that element to the &#60;name&#62; and evaluating the &#60;block&#62;. Using the for loop helps to use less code than while loop.
          <pre>
          for &#60;name&#62; in &#60;list&#62;:
          &#60;block&#62;
          </pre>
      Example:
          <pre>
          def find_element(p,t):
              i=0
              for e in p:
                if e==t:
                  return i
                i=i+1
                return -1
          </pre>
